/**
 * Objects of this class represent a set of sortable values.  The set

 * <p/>
 * - the set is kept in a sorted linked list
 * <p/>
 * - getting the size of the set - theta(1)
 * <p/>
 * - adding, removing, or searching for a random element - theta(n)
 * <p/>
 * - adding, removing, or searching for an element that
 * immediately follows the previously accessed element - theta(1)
 * <p/>
 * In other words, this set performs very well if additions or
 * removals occur with long sequential runs of ordered data values.
 * <p/>
 * Note:  This data structure is not threadsafe because instance
 * variables are used to keep track of visit state.  An iterator
 * would be a much better idea!
